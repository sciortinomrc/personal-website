				<h2>Hello there!</h2>
				<p>I am <b>Marco</b> from Italy, I have been living in the UK since October 2014 and I am a Full stack web developer.</p>
				I am married to Gaia and we have two cats: Ella and Chloe.<br />
				My passion for drama and musical theatre made me pack my whole world and move to this adventure called United Kingdom.<br />
				I have worked in various places from Fastfood to Big name retailer but it's never been for me. <br />
				I have also studied Musical Theatre in London but it was not the right path for me so I've decided
				it was time to give myself the best shot. <br />
				After a decade I went back to what I studied in high school: Computer programming and now here I am!<br />
				If you want to know more or want to discuss contract opportunities, give me a shout! You can find my contact details below!<br />
				<h4> I am looking forward to hearing from you </h4>
